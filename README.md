# Android app for physical exercises in physiotherapy
 
**This app was developed for my bachelor degree's final project in June 2021.**

###### What is Healthy Pose?
Healthy Pose is an Android app intended for people with certain body position dysfunctions that want to correct them. 
###### More details:
It is hoped that this application will inform users about their predisposition to certain body position dysfunctions and sustain a healthy lifestyle.
Firstly, the application requires user authentication to retain data about diagnosis and evolution to be assigned during the use of the application. It is necessary to use the camera to analyze the posture of the user's body via the Google Vision Pose Detection API. It determines the x, y, z coordinates in real time, for a set of thirty-three points of the body, and the probability that they can be found in the frame. Thus, with the help of algorithms implemented in this project, the angles between the points of major interest can be calculated and the diagnosis of the user is established (scoliosis, kyphosis, lordosis, varus knee or valgus knee, with a severity level also). The user also benefits from a progress page and sets of exercises that are represented by an **animated 3D model**. Thus, this easy-to-use application manages to identify physical deficiencies, and make sport and the deficiencies correction more enjoyable.
